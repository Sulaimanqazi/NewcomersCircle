### A simple forum for immigrants to communicate in

This website uses a Login/Signup system which provides usernames when communicating in the forum. It also ensures multiple accounts aren't created with the same username. It also checks if people created an account via signup before logging in. 

Users are able to create new threads, and add comments under each thread.
